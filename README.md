Hi We are a small software company in Germany looking for an application that will run a realtime deepfake of streamed videos from our server. 
We currently have over 60 1-minute sequences with the same person in the video files that need to be overlayed with a very broad spectrum of faces.
the faces to be faked will include both frontal and side views images.
We are in the medical field, specificaly in patient consultation.
I would be appreciate any ideas or just a shove in the right direction.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
